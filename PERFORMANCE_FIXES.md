# Performance Fixes Applied

## Frontend Message Display & Media Loading Optimizations

### 1. Performance Monitoring
- Added `useMessagePerformance` hook for tracking operation timing
- Created `messagePerformanceMonitor` utility for comprehensive performance tracking
- Added detailed logging for slow operations (>1000ms threshold)

### 2. Media Loading Optimizations
- Implemented `useMessageCache` hook with 5-minute expiry and 100-item limit
- Added retry functionality with visual feedback for failed loads
- Optimized LazyMediaContent component with caching and performance monitoring
- Added cache-first loading strategy to reduce redundant API calls

### 3. Message Deletion Improvements
- Enhanced error handling and logging for deletion operations
- Added performance timing for deletion operations
- Improved user feedback with detailed success/error messages
- Added timing verification for 7-minute deletion window

### 4. Database Optimizations
- Added indexes for better query performance:
  - `idx_messages_conversation_id` on messages(conversation_id)
  - `idx_messages_sent_at` on messages(sent_at)
  - `idx_messages_message_type` on messages(message_type)

### 5. Server-Side Performance Logging
- Added detailed timing logs for media endpoint (`/api/messages/:id/media`)
- Enhanced deletion endpoint logging with processing times
- Added verification logging for deletion time limits

### 6. Test Data & Performance Testing
- Created comprehensive test data (contacts, conversations, messages)
- Added performance testing script (`test-performance.sh`)
- Created curl-based endpoint timing tests

## Key Performance Improvements Expected

1. **Message Display Speed**: Cache-first loading should reduce display time from 13+ seconds to <1 second for cached content
2. **Media Loading**: Optimized loading with retry logic and better error handling
3. **Deletion Functionality**: Enhanced error handling and user feedback
4. **Database Queries**: Indexed queries should improve conversation and message loading
5. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO optimizations for better message broadcasting

## Testing Strategy

1. Test message sending and bubble display speed
2. Test media file uploads and display (images, videos, documents)
3. Test message deletion functionality
4. Verify Socket.IO real-time updates
5. Monitor browser console for performance logs
6. Test on production environment (educhat.galaxiasistemas.com.br)
